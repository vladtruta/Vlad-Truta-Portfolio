              <p>The <em>Student-in-Service</em> is a very common concept in Romanian schools. Basically, the students who are in service that day, are the ones responsible with cleaning the blackboards and keeping the classroom clean and tidy.</p>
              <p>This app does just that! You insert the students in any order you wish, either from the software built-in menus or from an external text file, and it automatically generates an Excel Spreadsheet on a set period of time, in a real calendar (usually it’s best to set full months).
              </p>
              <p>I developed it in order to fix a common problem we had in our classroom. Every month, someone had to create a spreadsheet with all the students, so we would know who is going to be the one in service that day. And they had to re-write this spreadsheet over and over, every month, in order to keep the correct rotation of the students.</p>

              <p>This game was made for the <a href="http://premiilecfa.ro/previous-winners" target="_blank">Prix&nbspCFA</a> Contest, Third Edition.</p>
              <p><em>Largonji</em> is a derivative of the French jargon louchébem. The louchébem word-creation process resembles that of verlan, and javanais, in that existing words are camouflaged according to a set of rules.</p>
              <p><em>Largonji</em> substitutes ⟨l⟩ for the consonant or consonant cluster at the beginning of the word, or, if the word begins with an ⟨l⟩ or a vowel, the second syllable; the initial consonant is then reattached to the end of the word along with a suffix particular to the argot: -ji [ʒi], -oc [ɔk], -ic [ik], -uche [yʃ], -ès [ɛs], or in the case of louchébem, -em/ème</p>
              <p>The word database is very big, and the cool thing about it is that it's hosted on my server. Everytime the game is launched, an API will keep it up to date.</p>
              <p>The game also has an option in which you can suggest new words to be added to the list. Facebook Integration is there, but still has some issues.</p>

              <p>Each room would have one Raspberry Pi, which has sensors connected to it. There is a central server, that gathers information from all connected Pi boards, processes the information, and sends it to a website, which displays the output in a user-friendly format (that is, there's a color which changes from red to green, depending on whether each room is empty or full).</p>

              <p><em>Goal-Keeper</em> is a Prototype for a Desktop Application, which helps you organize your schedule and achieve a life goal.</p> 
              <p>The purpose of the app is to help you analyze the amount of work, as well as the free time you will have, if you spend a set amount of hours a day. That way, you will be able to know, in a few weeks, or months time (longer or shorter, depending on how long achieving your goal will take), how much work/free time you will have each day. It also has a database in which you can set mementos, based on a built-in calendar.</p>
              <p>The work/free-time ratio is set using a slider, and the information is displayed right away, showing the advantage, as well as the trade-off in time, that you have by choosing that particular ratio.</p>

              <p>Magneteria is a project I did for a friend from India, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkBhEPwIBuk" target="_blank">Brijesh&nbspTiwari, who was a student at <em>Game Design & Development</em> at <em>ICAT Design & Media College</em></a>. He was in his final year, and so he had to design a game based on some given standards. I was responsible with the coding and implementation.</p>
              <p>Brijesh gave me the assets (the maps, the character sprite sheets, and the music), a very well-written document explaining the game’s mechanics and how it should work. My job was to code a game out of that. I didn’t get any help with the code, nor the engine whatsoever.</p>
              <p>Magneteria is a simple game prototype, in which your goal is to advance through levels, by lock-picking doors, solving small puzzle-based tasks, avoiding the guards, which move back and forth, and also avoiding security cameras.</p>

              <p>This is the VoiceInvoice app prototype that we built for <em>Life&nbspis&nbspHard</em> at the <strong>TechFest MegaHack</strong> hackathon. It generates an invoice using voice command.</p>
              <p>The application is easy to understand. It starts with an interface made up of input fields. Periodically, you will hear a beep. It usually happens every few seconds, though it does not have a set interval.</p>
              <p>Right after the beep, you say a voice command. All voice commands start with “okay”, in order to distinguish a voice command from regular text.</p>
              <p>We implemented a few voice commands for navigation, such as “okay next”, or “okay back”, and others for text processing.</p>

              <p>MyTradeMarket is the app we created for the <strong>PoliHack&nbspv3</strong> hackathon.</p>
              <p>MyTradeMarket is a private trade room prototype app. Just like private chat rooms, where you connect via IP address, our idea was to create the same thing, but oriented towards the selling/buying of products, and done privately.</p>
              <p>The advantage of this is that you don’t have to enter your credentials on any website in order to sell your products. Just add them into your private store, and give your customers your IP address, and they will connect and be able to see your products. We thought that this idea would help those who want to sell products in a hassle-free environment that doesn’t spy nor track buyers and sellers.</p>
              <p>The application was developed to work with Bitcoin, however it can be extended to work with about any type of currency.</p>

              <p>This is a website I created for someone. I did it for free. The person I made the site for is a dental technician, so he needed a simple but useful website which people could use in order to contact him.</p>
              <p>
              He had a website in the past, but it was awful and 80% of the images and links were broken. Mobile support was non-existent. I saw it and quickly realized I could do something to help him. And so I did. And I did it for free, just because I wanted him to get rid of that awful website he had before. And because this was one of my first projects I did for somebody else.</p>
              <p>The page contains all sorts of useful stuff: contact data, a Google Maps link of his HQ, a few photos of his past work and his tools in a slideshow, and last but not least, mobile support!</p>

              <p>I had the opportunity to attend, in the autumn of 2017, to a hackathon that was based on hardware programming.</p>
              <p>We were each given a Raspberry Pi, a bag of sensors and lots of wires. There were three different tasks for each team. Our task was to detect whether a room is full or empty, using motion sensors, as well as distance sensors. We had 24 hours to create something functional.</p>
              <p>So we came up with a simple, yet useful prototype. Each room would have one Raspberry Pi, which has sensors connected to it. There is a central server, that gathers information from all connected Pi boards, processes the information, and sends it to a website, which displays the output in a user-friendly format (that is, there's a color which changes from red to green, depending on whether each room is empty or full).</p>
              <p>There were a few obstacles we had to overcome, but we managed to deliver a nice proof of concept. This was my first time coding on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

              <p>At this hackathon, the theme was not fixed from the start. There were several companies, each of them bringing their own, different ideas. What they were trying to achieve was finding the right people to make their ideas a reality.</p>
              <p>After running around, brainstorming and asking for advice here and there, we finally decided to team up with <em>Life&nbspIs&nbspHard</em>. The title of the theme brought by them was <em>Mobile&nbspVoiceInvoice</em>.</p>
              <p>Basically, they needed a prototype for an Android app which fills an invoice, using voice command.</p>
              <p>So we came up with a prototype, which you can find on GitHub by clicking <strong>View Code</strong> below. It's just a prototype we had only 48 hours to do, but overall it was a pretty awesome experience.</p>

              <p>This was my fourth hackathon, and its theme was eHealth.</p>
              <p>
              We decided to develop a C#/Desktop app which helps you organize your schedule and achieve a goal, which can be anything you wish. The purpose of the app is to help you analyze the amount of work, as well as the free time you will have, if you spend a set amount of hours a day. That way, you will be able to know, in a few weeks, or months time (longer or shorter, depending on how long achieving your goal will take), how much work/free time you will have each day. It also has a database in which you can set mementos, based on a built-in calendar.</p>
              <p>
              Of course, this app is a prototype as well. At pitching, we were criticized for its complexity and lack of simplicity.</p>
              <p>But we learnt a valuable lesson from this: <strong>what</strong> you build is always more important than <strong>how</strong> you build it.</p>

              <p>With the winning of <em>PoliHack v3.0 Junior</em> section, our team won a free invitation to <em>Techsylvania</em>.</p>
              <p>It was more centered towards building apps using embedded devices and gadgets such as Oculus Rift, TheEyeTribe Eye Tracker, Leap Motion or Drones. Unfortunately, we did not have enough experience working with those cool gadgets, however we had a chance to test them all out.</p>
              <p>However, I had the honor to meet Mr. Mark Shuttleworth, CEO of Canonical (who apparently had an iPhone), as well as one of his acolyte geeks, the Linux-Guru Zygmunt "zyga" Krynicki. He helped us set up a Raspberry Pi.</p>
              <p>Overall, it was really nice. We were given the opportunity to attend for free, an otherwise paid event, and we loved it.</p>

              <p>This was the first hackathon I ever attended.</p>              
              <p>The theme was about building software related to e-commerce and online transactions. So, we thought of creating a private trade room. Just like private chat rooms, where you connect via IP address, our idea was to create the same thing, but oriented towards the selling/buying of products.</p>
              <p>The advantage of this is that you don’t have to enter your credentials on any website in order to sell your products. Just add them into your private store, and give your customers your IP address, and they will connect and be able to see your products. We thought that this idea would help those who want to sell products in a hassle-free environment that doesn’t spy nor track buyers and sellers.</p>     
              <p>Of course, it was a hackathon, so the application was, and still is, a prototype.</p>

              <p>I restarted my studies at <em>Academy+Plus</em>, after a break in which I had to prepare for my regular school exams.</p>
              <p>I got to work on several, very interesting projects that are based on coding algorithms, as well as the Unix OS (ex:&nbspparsing Standard Output using Shell commands).</p>
              <p>I had the opportunity to meet even more awesome, smart people. I am always happy to share my ideas with them, and I also have a lot to learn from them. The <em>Academy+Plus</em> community is very friendly and helpful, and also very determined to get things done efficiently.</p>
              <p>I am happy to be a part of this local guild of geeks.</p>

              <p>I took an Android Development Internship at Tapptitude, in the summer of 2016. The people working there were kind, and helpful when I needed it the most.</p>
              <p>During the Internship we were given a task, to create a note-keeping application, just like Google Keep. We started small, with a simple Login/Register menu, and then we kept adding features to it.</p>
              <p>Many of the things I had to work with were entirely new for me, so I learnt lots of valuable concepts, such as: Version Control, XML, Material Design and Database Integration.</p>
              <p>Also, there were times when we were taken to the meeting room and were shown a more theoretical approach of the concepts that we were about to learn, and this was especially the case of Git and its branching system.</p>

              <p>I attended the one-month <em>piscine</em> in August 2015. During that time, I practiced coding algorithms from scratch in C, as well as learning how to use Unix and its Shell.</p>
              <p>Each day we were given another set of assignments, which we had to complete until the next evening.</p>
              <p>There were also group projects we had to do, a few individual projects, and exams.</p>
              <p>My experience at <em>Academy+Plus</em> motivated me to go forward and start attending other hackathons and trainings.</p>
